# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
A: r_squared is around 0.625, which means the model is very "big", in terms of the coordinates are very specific, and with decimals.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
A: 138.65

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
A: It is probably the best it can be, but it is not good enough. The prediction is between all the points that are above and below it. Only one point connects with the Best Fit Line of the prediction point. It would be better if all the plots were closer to the line, that way it would be more accurate. Maybe the model could be smaller, so the data can be manipulated to think that the points are close to the line.
