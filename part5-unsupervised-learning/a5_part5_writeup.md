# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
A: Shopaholic would represent the people who have spent the most money on things, while frugal will be someone who rarely buys anything and saves money instead. It would also see why they have their shopping labels, maybe because they may or may not make a lot of money and may or may not have enough to spend it on things.
2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
A: They would be in a group where they shop at regular times, like maybe 1-2 times per week. In the graph it would be the red group
3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
A: There is the purple group, the shopaholics with medium income but high spending habits. A possible marketing idea is to see what they are buying and when they are buying it, and come up with a cheaper version of that specific product. If there is a problem with a spending habit, they can provide a service to help with those habits and make less purchases.
