# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
A: It has more data, for it has more predictions and it has testing and training data, giving more information on the investigation of Blood pressure by age


2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
A: r squared is around 0.64, which means the model has a similar size than the one from the last lesson, in terms of the coordinates are very specific, and with decimals. The difference is that it is slightly bigger, which means it is slightly bigger with more specific numbers/decimals

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
A: I'd say it is a bit more accurate than the one that was created in the last lesson. It is acuurate because more dots are in the position where it is touching the best fit line, and many others are near the line, showing that there is an average and that the results are similar with blood pressure as people age.
