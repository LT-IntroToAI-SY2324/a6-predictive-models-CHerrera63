# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
A: r squared is 0.86, which means there is a lot od big numbers, so the range is high with specific numbers and decimals
2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
A: No, there are some numbers that are negative, and sometimes not close to the actual amount compared to the predicted amount
3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
A: 10 yrs is around 7876.84 and 20yrs is around -172.15
4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
A: The amount of usage of the car can determine whether the price should be higher or should it be lower, how much it should gain or lose.
