# Project - Create your own predictive model
By: Cesar
Predictive models are used across industries to analyze and make predictions about data. From sports to beauty products to app usage, predictive models provide individuals and businesses with data to make informed decisions.

Throughout this module, you have learned how to program both supervised and unsupervised learning models. In this final project, you will create your own! Throughout this project, you will work through activities to complete the following steps:

1. Choose a dataset.
Ans: Dataset about specific people and their jobs in chicago, plus how much they make (Typical Hours and Hourly rate)
2. Determine which algorithm is the best fit. Based on the dataset you choose, you will need to figure out which algorithm to use. This will require you to get to know your data and your goals! Is there a linear correlation between variables? Are you looking for numerical value or a label/category? Do you know the labels or do you need the model to create them for you?
- Do some tests with matplotlib and visualize your data.  Does it provide a good correlation?  Why or why not?
Ans: It doesn't really provide a good correlation, because the best fit lie doesn't really fit or cross the other lines, not creating anything linear nor accurate.
3. Program your model. Once you have chosen your type of model, itâ€™s time to create it! In this step, you will write a program that fits your chosen model to the data. Your program and output will be specific to the model you choose.  
Ans: I've chosen the model from part 2, with the dotted graph and the line of best fit/the linear regression model
4. Analyze and present your findings. An important part of creating predictive models is being able to communicate the results. In this final step of the project, you will present your findings using slides or an infographic. Your product should include the following components:
- Your reasoning for the algorithm you chose
- An explanation and analysis of the output of your model: What results did your model produce? What do they mean?
- A prediction based on your model
- A summary of the accuracy of your model
- Real world implications
Ans: I chose this algorithm because it seems that it is the only one that is able to receive the data and is able to represent certain values for certain topics in my dataset(Typicl hours and hourly rate). It is also able to make inferences and conclusions about t=ceratin jobs in chicago. It resulted in a graph, where the line of best fit only goes through 3 dots out of 14. The rates seem to be high when typical hours are more than 30, and it would also depend on the job. when typical hours was 56, it was predicted that its hourly rate would be 76.37, when in reality would be 30.21. R squared was 0.19. The accuracy of the model is not very accurate, it would be if the data from the far end of both sides were erased, and if it was just between the hours of 30 and 45. Real World Implications show that Depending on jobs, an average work week has a high hourly rate, but the smaller, or the higher the hours, the less the rate. It would also contribute to their jobs and their salary.
